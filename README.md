calling_haskell_from_c
==============

Experiment calling haskell functions from c/c++.  The code is based on:
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Calling_Haskell_from_Co

and for build tricks:
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/FFI_complete_examples 

This includes a makefile you can use to automate compiling the bindings into
your projects.

The haskell code includes a simple fibonacci function, the c interface 
(which uses the fromIntegral haskell function to promote the numbers into the
higher level numeric format) and then finally a small C++ main that calls the
function.

The cool thing is that the haskell function becomes a normal (appearing) C++
function, so the total footprint in C++ for the function call is
- #include for the (autogenerated) header
- hs_init() call
- actual function call (in this case fibonacci_hs()
- hs_exit() call

Let me know if you have any questions/suggestions!

I'm new to haskell, so this code was copied out of the haskell wiki.
