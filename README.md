calling_haskell_from_c
==============

Experiment calling haskell functions from c/c++.  The code is based on:
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Calling_Haskell_from_Co
and for build tricks:
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/FFI_complete_examples 

This includes a makefile you can use to automate compiling the bindings into
your projects.

Let me know if you have any suggestions!
